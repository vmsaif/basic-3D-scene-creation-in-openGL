This project demonstrates the creation of a 3D scene using OpenGL. The scene encompasses a textured background, composite 3D objects, multiple light sources, and an atmospheric attenuation effect.

## Features

- A textured background.
- Five 3D composite objects, each composed of at least five geometric shapes.
- Two distinct light sources with varying lighting colors.
- An atmospheric attenuation effect, specifically fog.
- Efficient rendering using complex display lists.
